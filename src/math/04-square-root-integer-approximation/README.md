## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return **the square root of `x` rounded down** to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

- **Input**: `x = 4`
- **Output**: `2`
- **Explanation**: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

### Example 2:

- **Input**: `x = 8`
- **Output**: `2`
- **Explanation**: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

## Constraints

- `0 <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`


---


## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log x)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
